### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a computer engineer, my passion lies in researching and developing deep learning algorithms with a focus on computer vision. I possess a strong background in both theoretical concepts and practical implementations of deep learning.

I am driven by a genuine passion for exploring the boundaries of artificial intelligence and making a meaningful impact through innovative projects.

This project proposes a new facial emotional recognition model using a convolutional neural network. Therefore, a convolutional neural network based solution combined with image processing is used in classification of universal emotions.



Frontal face images are given as input to the system. To complete the training of the CNN network model, I used the CK+ (Extended Cohn-Kanade dataset) CNN consists of four layers of convolution together with fully connected layers. The features extracted by the HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients), Convolutional Neural network (CNN) from facial expressions images were fused to develop the classification model through training by our proposed CNN model.



Additionally, for improved accuracy and prediction, a more advanced CNN network model was employed using the FER2013 dataset.
